# LSM VEM
Initial attempt to implement Gollini (2014) in Python. Essentially a method to extract a hidden state of an underlying realization of a network (for example a social network). For faster computation Gollini recommended using a ADVI approach.

This was my try to implement this method but is uncompleted and abandoned.
